Global Alliance DWG Reads Task Team
===================================

The [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](http://genomicsandhealth.org/) is an international coalition, formed to enable the sharing of genomic and clinical data.
The [Data Working Group](http://genomicsandhealth.org/files/public/Priorities%20-%20without%20membership%20DWG_0.pdf) concentrates on data representation, storage, and analysis, including working with platform development partners and industry leaders to develop standards that will facilitate interoperability.
The [Reads Task Team](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dwgreadtaskteam) is focused on standards for accessing genomic read data -- collections of primary data collected from sequencing machines.

The team will deliver:
  1. Data model. An abstract, mathematically complete and precise model of the data that is manipulated by the API. See the [AVRO directory](https://github.com/ga4gh/schemas/tree/master/src/main/resources/avro) for our in-progress work on defining v0.5 of the data model. 
  2. API Specification. A human-readable document introducing and defining the API, accompanied by a formal specification. See the [documentation page](https://ga4gh.github.io/apis/reads/v0.1/) for the published v0.1 API.
  3. Reference Implementation. Open source working code demonstrating the API, ideally which can underpin real world working implementations.
